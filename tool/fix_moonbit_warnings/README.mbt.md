# `moonbitlang/maria/tool/fix_moonbit_warnings`

Interactive tool for fixing MoonBit compiler warnings.

## Overview

This tool provides an interactive workflow for fixing MoonBit compiler warnings and errors. It presents code segments with issues and allows the agent to submit fixes for verification.

## Parameters

Varies based on the tool phase:
- Initial request provides diagnostic information
- Submit tool receives fixed code segments

## Workflow

1. **Identify Issues**: Tool shows code segments with warnings/errors
2. **Submit Fixes**: Agent submits corrected code via `submit_moonbit_segment`
3. **Verification**: Tool checks if the fix resolves the issue
4. **Iteration**: Process repeats until all issues are fixed

## Sub-tools

### `submit_moonbit_segment`
- Receives fixed code segment
- Validates the fix by re-checking
- Returns success or additional diagnostics

## Use Cases

- Fixing compiler warnings
- Resolving type errors
- Correcting syntax issues
- Iterative code refinement
- Automated code cleanup

## Notes

- Part of the maria AI agent tool system
- Provides interactive fix-verify loop
- Checks fixes before applying them
- Supports iterative refinement
- Ensures changes compile successfully
